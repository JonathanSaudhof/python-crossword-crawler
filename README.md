# python-crossword-crawler

My first attempt to get into python again after 3 years. 
The crawler gets all questions and related answers for a crossword game from a german site.

## Challenges:
1. Unfortunately I had to follow a nested link to get the answers. 
2. Started synchronously and moved to asyncio to improve the crawl speed
3. Struggled with connection los due to server time outs and DDoS prevention.
4. Dealed with caching the already crawled data to not crawl them again.

## Comment:
Was quite fun!
